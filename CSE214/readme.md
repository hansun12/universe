# CSE214

This is a course designed to introduce core concepts in data structures and theirrelated algorithms. We will go over some of the most fundamental and often-used programming constructs(known as data structures) and the associated algorithms that will help you store, manage, and manipulateyour data efficiently. In addition to the data structures, we'll also study slightly more theoretical conceptsinvolving complexity analysis and recursions.
